#child processes
The child_process module provides the ability to spawn new processes which has their own memory.
The communication between these processes is established through IPC (inter-process communication) provided by the operating system.

There are mainly three methods inside this module that we care about.

child_process.spawn()
child_process.fork()
child_process.exec()

#child_process.spawn()
This method is used to spawn a child process asynchronously.
This child process can be any command that can be run from a terminal.

#child_process.fork()
child_process.fork() is specifically used to spawn new nodejs processes.
Like spawn, the returned childProcess object will have built-in IPC communication channel that allows messages to be passed back and forth between the parent and child.

1. Only parent to child process communication is possible and there is no child to child communication.
2. Separate memory is allocated for each child process which means that there is a time and resource overhead.

#Worker threads
Worker threads can be used to solve the above-mentioned caveats with child processes because worker threads share memory and communication between threads is possible.
Essentially the difference between worker threads and child processes is same as the difference between a thread and a process.Ideally,
the number of threads created should be equal to number of cpu cores.

#Cluster
Cluster is mainly used for vertically (adding more power to your existing machine) scale your nodejs web server. It is built on top of the child_process module. In an Http server, the cluster module uses child_process.fork() to automatically fork processes and sets up a master-slave architecture where the parent process distributes the incoming request to the child processes in a round-robin fashion. Ideally, the number of processes forked should be equal to the number of cpu cores your machine has.
